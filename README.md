 A COVID-19 face mask detector with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, and Deep Learning.:relaxed:

<h2> Motivation<span style='font-size:100px;'>&#127775;</span></h2>	
<p>
This project was inspired by seeing others implement their own solutions. Since I had some knowledge in that field, I wanted to try my hands on it also. I'm going to build from <a href="https://github.com/prajnasb/observations">Prajna Bhandry's</a> work. I believe this will go along way to ensure the safety of others when implemented by the medical professionals.
</p>

## Features :gem:
* Dataset
To create the dataset, Prajna had an ingenious solution of:
<p>-Taking normal images of faces</p>
<p>-Then creating a python script to add face masks by using facial landmarks. You can refer to <a href="https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/mask_classifier/Data_Generator">Prajna's GitHub repository</a> to find out how this is done.
(When using an artificial dataset of people wearing masks, the images without masks in the training setcannot be re-used. Non-face mask images images that were not used in the artificial generation process need to be gathered. If not done this way, the model will become heavily biased and fail to generalize well.)</p>

## Installation :package:
1. Clone the repo
```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/aibenStunner/face-mask-detector.git
   $ cd image-search-engine
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
